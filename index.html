Title:                  DEREK ARROTTA PORTFOLIO WEBSITE (flexbox and media queries)
Author:                 Derek Arrotta
Completion Date:        OCT-13-2020
Description/Comments:   This is the primary html code for my portfolio website. Comments below may seem excessive, but are intended for my learning 
                        purposes since this is the first website I've built. This is built off of the original "portfolio-site", with flexbox and media queries added.

                                    <p>Metro <em>Detroit</em> (MI) transplant from the Pacific Northwest. I graduated in 2014 with 
                                    a degree in <em>Mechanical Engineering</em>, and spent the last 6 years working for General Motors. After becoming
                                    dissatisfied with the work, I decided it was time to make a change and move into a new career as a <em>software
                                    engineer</em>. So I joined the <em>Thinkful</em>  Bootcamp in September 2020 and I'm so happy I did! Its been challenging,
                                    but so rewarding, and I hope to develop awesome software and apps in the near future. If you're looking to 
                                    collaborate, or are hiring, please feel free to reach out!
